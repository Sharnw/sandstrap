# Sandstrap
Lightweight bootstrap for plugging into existing PHP projects.

# Introduction
I can't count the number of times I've been handed over a prototype or legacy PHP project, where  I've needed to quickly throw in some structure before things start looking like spaghetti.

As a fan of lightweight frameworks I wanted something that I could plug into an existing project and add some consistency & structure without having to rewrite a lot of code.

Each time I've built this kind of solution I've refined the classes I use a little more. This is my first attempt at combining them into a single concept.

Projects I've utilised:

Props to radiosilence for Ham router. It's lightweight and fits into what I want to do perfectly. - https://github.com/radiosilence/Ham

I've also thrown in Pure CSS - https://github.com/yahoo/pure
